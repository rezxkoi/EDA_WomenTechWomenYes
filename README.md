A client has come to Sophie, Kim, & Rita in desperate need of help. We are passing this task on to you, our very capable students. The client could really benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you help them reach their goals?

For this project, you are going to deliver a preliminary analysis to your client. Your goal is to address their needs so that they can use data to inform their business choices.

To do this, you will take advantage of free, accessible data about the patterns of transit traffic in New York City: MTA turnstile data. Using this data source, as well as any other relevant dataset(s) of your choosing, perform an exploratory analysis in Python and SQL that offers insightful and actionable quantitative findings (including visualizations) to your client. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation at the end of week 2 and a short written description.
