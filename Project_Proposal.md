Question/need:
What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
There is going to be a gala held in the begining of summer ( june 2022 ) and the model is to gather as much emails/signitures ( which basically would be invites ).
The purpose of the of model will be to optimize our invite in 3 factors:
1. Maximum Invites
2. Maximum attentance 
4. Maximum Contribution


Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
The organization of WTWY will be the direct beneficiary of this model and eventually the target beneficairies would be:
1. Women who have interest in being in Tech 
2. Men or Wemon who support this idea


Data Description:
What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
Generally the data Best data to use to optimize the goals above chosen only from the MTA would be ( assuming the gala is begining of June 2022)
1. Data from a month before the event 
2. March is " Women History Month" - 
( need to get reliable data! due to the pandemic, we might have low data for the years 2021 and 2020. May need to consider other years for more accurate data)
3. During annual Tech conventions (April & November) 
Besides the data on MTA:
1.Recognizing the highly populated stations in NY
2.Recognizing rush-rush hours ( might not get signitues die to rushing)
3. The event is going to be during Covid Pandemic, so do want to have a safe event with mostly vaccinated people.

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
The main columns that would be most valuebale to focus on are probably Date(mainly due to day of the week), Hour, Enterires and Exits from the MTA data.
More likly paying attention to the stations ( and basically their locatoin ) would provide us better info and eventually optimized solution.
If modeling, what will you predict as your target? The optimum rate of attendance ( attend / invite ) + Diversity + Contribution?

Tools:
How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
1.SQLite/SQLalchamey
2.Matplotlib
3.Pandas
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
planning to use what we can achieve with the tools we have and later on maybe manipulate data with other tools possible in order to achieve better results.
